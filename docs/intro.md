# Welcome to [Random Rants +](https://randomrants-plus.onrender.com)

_(The page nobody reads, but you probably should.)_

## So, what is this place?

Random Rants + is the goofy, chaotic site built for you and your friends to hang out online. It’s a digital hideout, made for both escaping school and just good ol' online chatting.

This isn't your average polished, corporate chat app. This is a place for small bursts of chaos, built by people who sacrificed their homework to make it happen.

## Who's This For?

Students that need a break (or just want to finally escape class).

Anyone looking for a simple way to talk and hang out online.

People who enjoy screaming loud on video calls and spamming meme soundboards.

If you're looking for a place with no filters, weird commands, and the constant threat of a perfectly timed loud noise, you're in the right place.
