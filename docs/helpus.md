# Help us with ads

We're looking for people to help us advertise [Random Rants +](https://randomrants-plus.onrender.com).

## What is this? (Short)

[Random Rants +](https://randomrants-plus.onrender.com) is a real time chat site made by Gvbvdxx (me, which used to be a part of the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) community, but got banned), and [Im_CatmanYT](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Im_CatmanYT) (Met him in real life) that made the ideas and came up with the name.

## How to help

Use platforms like [YouTube](https://youtube.com) to make videos like screenrecordings of Random Rants + and it's features.
Or post comments on random sites, and hope people click it.
