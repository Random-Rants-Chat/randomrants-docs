# Help us with ads

We're looking for people to help us advertise [Random Rants +](https://randomrants-plus.onrender.com).

Try it here: [https://randomrants-plus.onrender.com](https://randomrants-plus.onrender.com).

## What is this? (Short)

[Random Rants +](https://randomrants-plus.onrender.com) is a real time chat site made by Gvbvdxx (me, which used to be a part of the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) community, but got banned), and [Im_CatmanYT](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Im_CatmanYT) (Met him in real life) that made the ideas and came up with the name.

We didn't make this for nobody to use it, but the more recognition means that more people can use it and rely on this - which is good so that you have chances of meeting other people and this site becomes more exiting to us.

## How to help

Use platforms like [YouTube](https://youtube.com) to make videos like screenrecordings of Random Rants + and it's features.
Or post comments on random sites (at good places), and hope people click it.
