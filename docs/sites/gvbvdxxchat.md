# Gvbvdxx Chat

:::info
This site no longer works, but you can still access it [here](https://jasonglenevans.github.io/GvbvdxxChat/).
:::

This site was posted by me a lot on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), it wasn't used for evading the moderation, rather just looking for a way to talk to people on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) in real time. This was the base code for [Macre's Chat](./macreschat.md).

This site was known for getting me blocked from the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) community, but this wasn't the last block I had before Scratch Team stopped trusting me to be unblocked.
