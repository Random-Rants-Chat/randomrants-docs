:::info
This site no longer has a working server due to its significant security issues. However, you can experiment with a sandboxed version that uses a fake, in-browser server.
[View the safe version here](https://gvbvdxx-chat-safe.github.io/MacresChat)

_**Some functions of the safe version don't work, and won't be fixed.**_
:::

This site was a friend requested one, he wanted to modify the code to make his own chat site, we communicated on Kosmi, trying to teach him how to modify the site, later gave up and did all the work for him.

This still had all the security issues, and wasn't talked about on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu).

It also had added more commands. (list them using `;commands`)

## Screenshots

_The *Open Sandbox* button is part of CodeSandbox, and is not in the actual site._
