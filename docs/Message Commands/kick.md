# `;kick` Command

:::info
This command is an owner-only command, only people with ownership can use this. (the room owner, and any promoted people)
:::

This kicks the specified user from the room. This will stop their connection and send them to their chat home page.
:::warning
This **IS NOT** a ban or mute command, this should be used only if the user is inactive and annoying. If you see the user breaking your rules, than you can use the block list function in Random Rants +.

Some good times to use this command would be:

- The user is inactive but online, with loud background noise coming from their mic.
- A small warning if the user does something wrong.
