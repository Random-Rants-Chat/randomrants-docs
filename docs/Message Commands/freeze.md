This kicks the specified user from the room. This will stop their connection and send them to their chat home page.

This **IS NOT** a ban or mute command, this should be used only if the user is inactive and annoying. If you see the user breaking your rules, than you can use the block list function in Random Rants +.

Some good times to use this command would be:

- The user is inactive but online, with loud background noise coming from their mic.
- A small warning if the user does something wrong.

This doesn't stop them from typing in textboxes though until they click or tap on their screen.
